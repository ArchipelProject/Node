		This procedure, recommended for developers modifying oVirt, uses pungi to create a local repository of required Fedora RPMs (greater than 1GB) making subsequent rebuilds faster. In your oVirt source repository clone, execute the build script to compile the appliance:

<screen># ./build-all.sh -ac -b </screen>

and proceed to step 3 below.</para></formalpara>

		<step><para>Download create-wui-appliance.sh script onto the host machine.</step></para>
		<step><para> Run this script as root; you can use pre-built appliance image or build the appliance from scratch if you point it at the location of your Fedora installation tree or boot ISO
		o Using Fedora installation tree (without boot ISO) NOTE replace download.fedora.redhat.com URL with your local mirror

<screen># bash wui-appliance-create-wui-appliance.sh \
-t http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/9/Fedora/i386/os/ \
-k http://ovirt.org/download/wui-rel-i386.ks -b</screen>

		or

<screen># bash wui-appliance-create-wui-appliance.sh \
-t http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/9/Fedora/x86_64/os/ \
-k http://ovirt.org/download/wui-rel-x86_64.ks -b</screen>

		o Using Fedora boot ISO

		<screen># bash wui-appliance-create-wui-appliance.sh -i /tmp/boot.iso -b</screen>

		<command>virt-viewer</command> screen pops up and when you see the boot screen, make sure to hit the <keypress>Tab</keypress> key, and then append <command>ks=http://ovirt.org/download/wui-rel-x86_64.ks ksdevice=eth0</command> (for x86_64) or <command>ks=http://ovirt.org/download/wui-rel-i386.ks ksdevice=eth0</command> (for i386) to the boot line.</step></para>-->

<para> After installation has finished, the guest should be rebooted to perform first-run setup. At the end of the boot process, you will see a message saying "Starting ovirt-dev-wui-first-run:". This command will take a while to finish, and is completely normal.</para>
		<para> At this point, your appliance should be ready. Now, you can bring up the main oVirt screen by running firefox on the guest (here you'll need the root password, which is ovirt):

		<screen># ssh -fY root@192.168.50.2 firefox -no-remote</screen>

		To connect to the console of a virtual machine running on a managed node use:

		<screen># ssh -fY root@192.168.50.2 virt-viewer -c qemu+tcp://node3.priv.ovirt.org/system VM_NAME</screen>
