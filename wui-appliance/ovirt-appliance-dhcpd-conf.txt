This file explains the various options DHCP options necessary, and how Ovirt
uses them.  All of these really must be right for things to work, so please
read carefully.  Also note that I will refer to the "appliance" frequently in
the following information; this means the Ovirt WUI appliance that you can
download from ovirt.org.

Let's start with the example dhcpd.conf from the ovirt-appliance-setup.txt:

I'll go through each line (or set of related lines) and explain what they are
for:

Lines 1-2:  These specify that this DHCP server should allow booting clients
            connect.  This is necessary since the individual Ovirt hosts will
            boot using PXE, and hence need to get an IP address/PXE information
            from this DHCP server.

Lines 3-4:  These specify how DHCP interacts with DNS.  For the most part, you
            can leave these as-is; if you have special circumstances, you can
            modify these for your environment.  If you don't know what I am
            talking about, don't touch these.

Lines 6-9:  These are known as DHCP option records; they are basically
            extensions to the DHCP protocol that allow you to pass arbitrary
            information from a DHCP server to clients.  Ovirt requires a number
            of these DHCP options.  Some sites actually already use certain
            DHCP option records; if your site is one of these, *and* the option
            record number conflicts with one of the above, read on, otherwise
            skip to the next section.  If your in-use option records conflict
            with what Ovirt wants to use, you *can* change these numbers, but
            then you'll need to go into the ovirt-host-creator/ovirt.ks
            kickstart, modify the equivalent options in there, and re-build your
            Ovirt host image.

Line 11:    This line specifies which subnet this DHCP server is going to serve.
            This will be the subnet that your Ovirt WUI will live on, as well as
            all of your Ovirt hosts.

Line 12:    This line specifies which domain name will be handed out to DHCP
            clients.  For Ovirt purposes, this mostly specifies the search path
            the Ovirt hosts will use when trying to resolve DNS names.

Line 13:    This line specifies which domain name servers will be handed out to
            DHCP clients.  You can specify a number of comma separated IP
            addresses here.  Make sure these IP addresses are reachable from
            this subnet, otherwise things will not work properly.

Line 14:    This line specifies where the PXE server that will serve out the
            Ovirt host image lives.  If you are using the appliance, this IP
            address should be the same as the appliance IP.  If your PXE server
            lives elsewhere, you'll need to specify the appropriate IP address.

Line 15:    This line specifies the default gateway that clients should use.

Line 16:    This line specifies where the iscsi server(s) are that Ovirt hosts
            should use.  For now, the iscsi servers must be up and running *and*
            already exporting the LUNs you will want to use, before you boot
            up any Ovirt host.  This will become much more dynamic in the
            future.

Line 17:    This line specifies where the TFTP server for Ovirt is.  This will
            always be the same as the value in "next-server".  If you are using
            the appliance, this IP address should be the same as the appliance
            IP.

Line 18:    This line specifies where the Ovirt hosts should send performance
            monitoring information.  If you are using the appliance, this IP
            address should be the same as the appliance IP.  Otherwise, it
            should be set to the same IP address as the Ovirt WUI is running on.

Line 19:    This line specifies the authentication method libvirt should use
            to talk to Ovirt hosts.  This is specified as "<auth>:<server>".
            Currently, the only supported <auth> type is krb5 (for Kerberos
            encryption/authentication).  The <server> section is a little
            special; it actually specifies an http server that is serving out
            the kerberos keytab files for the various Ovirt hosts.  If you are
            using the appliance, this should be set to
            "applianceIP:8089".

Line 20:    This line specifies the range of dynamic IP addresses that this
            DHCP server will serve out.  For now, it's best to have
            fixed-address for your Ovirt hosts (since we depend on stable
            hostnames); this is described in more detail in the
            ovirt-appliance-setup.txt document.

Line 21:    This line describes the name of the PXE file that the Ovirt
            hosts will first fetch.  This should not be changed.
