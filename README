To do the setup for an Ovirt host, look in the ovirt-host-creator/ directory
and read INSTALL and README.

To setup a management application, look in the wui/ directory.

Temporary: we don't have a README for the wui directory yet, so I'll just put
this info here so I don't lose it.

To make the task-omatic part of the WUI work properly, we have to create a
keytab for it and put it in the right spot.  This is so that taskomatic can
properly authenticate to the freeipa server.

On the freeipa server:
# kadmin.local
  > addprinc -randkey libvirt/<hostname>@<realm> (where <hostname> is the DNS
                                                  name of the machine where the
                                                  WUI is running, and <realm>
                                                  is the realm you are using)
  > modprinc +requires_preauth libvirt/<hostname>@<realm>
  > ktadd -k /tmp/taskomatic.keytab libvirt/<hostname>@<realm>
  > quit
# scp /tmp/taskomatic.keytab wui:/usr/share/invirt-wui/ovirt.keytab (where 'wui' is the name of the machine where the WUI is running)
